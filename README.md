# Runt
By Paul Batchelor

Runt is a quirky stack-based virtual machine built to work with 
[Polysporth](http://pbat.ch/proj/polysporth.html). 

Here are some features:

- Stack-based: heavily inspired by Forth
- Memory-pool allocation system: only one call to malloc/free needed!
- built-in parser and interpretor
- written in ANSI C
- simple API for defining new words

This repo is a work in progress... stay tuned!
